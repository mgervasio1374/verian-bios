# MCM Staging Pilot — Issue Ledger

**Purpose:** a lightweight running log of every bug / gap / lesson found while bringing Manual
Campaign Mode live on staging. **Record fast, triage later.** Append a new entry the moment
something surfaces; distill into real fixes/backlog in a later pass.

**How to add an entry:** copy the block, bump the ID, fill it in. Keep it terse.
Severity: `blocker` (pipeline dead) · `major` (feature unusable) · `minor` · `cosmetic` · `process` (lesson, not a defect).
Status: `open` · `fix-drafted` · `fixed-staging` · `resolved` · `noted`.

## ISSUE-001 — Campaign crons crash: `workspaces.deleted_at does not exist`
- **Date:** 2026-06-09 · **Severity:** blocker · **Status:** fix-drafted (commit + redeploy pending)
- **Area:** Inngest crons — `process-campaign-schedule`, `process-campaign-approvals`, `process-campaign-sends` (+ pre-existing `scheduled-learning-agent-run`)
- **Symptom:** empty Approval Inbox after assigning a lead; Inngest run **Failed** — `enumerate-active-tenants: column workspaces.deleted_at does not exist`.
- **Root cause:** the `enumerate-active-tenants` step filters `workspaces` by `.is('deleted_at', null)`, but `workspaces` has no `deleted_at` (it has `status`). Bug originated in `scheduled-learning-agent-run` and was mirrored into the 3 MCM crons (Slice 3 prompt said to mirror it).
- **Why missed:** untyped service client (`createClient<any>`) → compiles; source-read tests never execute the query → suite green. Runtime-only.
- **Fix:** drop `.is('deleted_at', null)` in all 4 files + regression guard asserting no `deleted_at`. (Hotfix drafted.)
- **Class:** `untyped-client-schema-mismatch` / `source-read-blind-spot`.

## ISSUE-002 — Campaign types not seeded (prerequisite gap)
- **Date:** 2026-06-09 · **Severity:** major · **Status:** fixed-staging (prereq to document for prod)
- **Area:** Campaign Sequences builder / data seeding
- **Symptom:** Campaign Type dropdown empty → can't author a sequence. (Assets existed; types did not.)
- **Root cause:** `campaign_types` table empty for the tenant; **no UI to create campaign types**; assets don't create them.
- **Fix:** seeded 2 types via SQL on staging (`initial_contact`, `statement_follow_up`, both `active`, ws `main`). Slug must equal the assets' `campaign_type` AND be a standard `CAMPAIGN_TYPE` so the assignment picker shows the sequence.
- **Action:** add **"seed campaign types per workspace"** to go-live prereqs; consider a campaign-type admin UI.
- **Class:** `data-seeding-prereq` / `missing-admin-ui`.

## ISSUE-003 — Stale "Runtime note" banner on Campaign Sequences page
- **Date:** 2026-06-09 · **Severity:** cosmetic · **Status:** open
- **Area:** `app/(workspace)/[workspaceSlug]/settings/campaign-sequences/page.tsx`
- **Symptom:** banner reads "…require migration 20240045 to be applied. The sequence builder is dormant until that operator step is complete" — but 20240045 is applied; misleading.
- **Root cause:** hardcoded note added in Slice 9 page.tsx.
- **Fix:** remove/condition the banner (quick follow-up).
- **Class:** `stale-ui-copy`.

## ISSUE-004 — Deploy-before-migrate ordering window (process)
- **Date:** 2026-06-09 · **Severity:** process · **Status:** noted
- **Symptom:** pushing code (master→staging) before applying 20240045/46 opened a window where `createCampaignAssignment` errored (insert references `campaign_sequence_id` before the column existed).
- **Lesson:** for **production**, migrate-then-deploy (not deploy-then-migrate). On staging it was low-stakes and closed by running Phase B promptly.
- **Class:** `release-ordering`.

## ISSUE-005 — Manually invoking an event handler with empty payload crashes it (operator note)
- **Date:** 2026-06-09 · **Severity:** process · **Status:** noted
- **Symptom:** `on-campaign-assignment-activated` run **Failed** — `listCampaignScheduleItemsForAssignment: invalid input syntax for type uuid: "undefined"`; trigger was `inngest/function.invoked`.
- **Cause:** the function was **Invoked from the dashboard with no payload**. It's event-triggered (`campaign.assignment_activated`) and needs `{assignmentId, tenantId, workspaceId,…}`. The real event-driven run succeeded (assignment had 2 materialized items). Red herring.
- **Lesson:** only Invoke the **crons** (`process-campaign-*`) with an empty payload. For event handlers, let the real event fire (or Invoke with a valid payload). Verified materialize works — ISSUE-001 (promotion cron) is the actual blocker.
- **Class:** `operator-runbook`.

## ISSUE-006 — No operator UI to manually stop a sequence
- **Date:** 2026-06-10 · **Severity:** major · **Status:** open
- **Area:** lead/assignment view; `stopCampaignSequenceAction` (modules/messaging/actions/campaign-assignment.actions.ts)
- **Symptom:** `stopCampaignSequenceAction` (stops all pending schedule items → `stopped_manual` + retires assignment) exists and is unit-tested, but is **not wired to any `.tsx`** — no button. The assignment card only has **"Retire"** (`retireCampaignAssignmentAction`), which retires the assignment but does **NOT** transition pending schedule items to `stopped_manual` — so a "Retire" alone could leave due/approved items dispatchable.
- **Impact:** during the pilot, manual stop must be done via DB (done for the drill on assignment `e34449aa` — both items → `stopped_manual`, assignment → `retired`, verified). Before Bruce self-serves he needs a real "Stop campaign" control.
- **Fix:** add a "Stop sequence" button on the assignment card calling `stopCampaignSequenceAction`; clarify/!merge with "Retire" semantics (stop should retire AND stop items).
- **Class:** `missing-operator-ui` / `action-not-surfaced`.

## ISSUE-007 — Bounce/complaint auto-stop never fires: wrong Resend payload shape
- **Date:** 2026-06-10 · **Severity:** major (bounce-suppression dead) · **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED (commit `dce6cf3`, verified live 2026-06-10 — clean real-bounce re-test auto-blocked step 2)
- **Area:** `app/api/webhooks/resend/route.ts` → `processResendEvent` (hard-bounce detection)
- **Symptom:** a real hard bounce (sent to `bounced@resend.dev`, msg `62fcef87…`) → `email_send.status` correctly → `bounced`, but the campaign's pending step 2 was **NOT** blocked (stayed `planned`), and **no** `EMAIL_PERMANENT_BOUNCE` structured error was created.
- **Root cause:** handler checks `payload.data.bounce_type === 'hard'` (route.ts:300, and again in the structured-error context line ~311). Resend's real payload has **no `bounce_type`** — it nests: `data.bounce = { type: 'Permanent', subType: 'General', message, diagnosticCode }`. So the guard is always false → `stopCampaignScheduleForSend` is never called.
- **Scope:** gates BOTH (a) the MCM bounce auto-stop AND (b) the permanent-bounce structured error. The `email_send.status` update is fine (keys off `eventType`, not bounce_type).
- **Downstream verified GOOD:** manual SQL block proved step 2 → `blocked` / `status_reason='recipient_bounced'` once triggered — the cascade is correct; only the trigger condition is wrong.
- **Fix:** read the nested object — `const bounce = payload.data?.bounce as {type?:string; subType?:string} | undefined; const isHardBounce = bounce?.type === 'Permanent'` (treat `Permanent`=hard; `Transient`/`Undetermined`=soft → no stop). Update both the stop guard (line 300) and the structured-error `bounceType` context (line ~311) to use `bounce.type`/`bounce.subType`. Optionally also accept legacy `data.bounce_type==='hard'` defensively.
- **Also check:** the complaint path (`email.complained`, line ~330) keys off `eventType` only (no bounce_type) so likely OK — but confirm Resend's complaint payload shape with a real `complained@resend.dev` test before trusting complaint auto-stop.
- **Tests:** the slice-8 unit test used the assumed `{bounce_type:'hard'}` shape → green while prod fails. Replace the fixture with the real Resend shape (`data.bounce.type='Permanent'`) + add a captured-payload regression fixture.
- **Class:** `external-payload-shape-mismatch` / `source-read-blind-spot` (**P1**).

## ISSUE-008 — Bounce/complaint auto-stop is fire-and-forget → unreliable on serverless
- **Date:** 2026-06-10 · **Severity:** major (bounce-stop flaky) · **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED (commit `99be74d`, verified live 2026-06-10 — step 2 auto-blocked on the FIRST real bounce, deterministically)
- **Area:** `app/api/webhooks/resend/route.ts` → `processResendEvent` (bounce + complaint side effects)
- **Symptom:** with the ISSUE-007 fix deployed, a real hard bounce (msg `17f70aa2`, assignment `ab8280cb`) created the `EMAIL_PERMANENT_BOUNCE` structured error **but did NOT block the pending step 2**. A second delivery of the same bounce (synthetic POST, same `correlation_id 902dca71…`) **did** block it. Same code, same data → non-deterministic.
- **Root cause:** `stopCampaignScheduleForSend(...).catch(...)` (line 327 bounce, 358 complaint) is **not awaited**. `processResendEvent` is awaited by the POST handler, but the stop call inside fires-and-forgets. On Vercel the function freezes after the `200` response; the slower stop (draft lookup → pending list → per-item update) gets cut off, while the single-insert structured error usually finishes. ISSUE-007 (payload shape) was necessary but **not sufficient** — detection now works, completion is flaky.
- **Fix:** `await` the stop inside `processResendEvent` (keep the `.catch` so it stays non-fatal): `await stopCampaignScheduleForSend(...).catch(err => …)` at both line 327 and 358. Consider awaiting the structured-error creators too (or `Promise.allSettled` the side-effect promises) so all post-event work completes before the handler returns. The POST handler already wraps `processResendEvent` in try/catch → 200 is still guaranteed.
- **Tests:** add an assertion that the bounce/complaint stop is `await`ed (source-read: `await stopCampaignScheduleForSend`), so this can't regress to fire-and-forget.
- **Class:** `serverless-fire-and-forget` / `unawaited-side-effect`.

## Patterns / themes (to distill later)

- **P1 — Untyped service client + source-read tests = runtime-only schema bugs.** The repos use `createClient<any>`, so column/typo mistakes compile; source-read tests never run them. (ISSUE-001 is the first instance; expect more as each cron/query runs against the real schema for the first time.)
  - *Mitigations to weigh:* (a) **smoke-test each cron's first real run** in the Inngest dashboard during go-live; (b) regenerate `types/database.ts` post-migration and migrate the hottest queries onto the typed client; (c) a thin integration test that executes each cron's enumerate/list against a seeded DB.
- **P2 — Per-workspace data must be seeded** (campaign types; verified sender; ≥1 active asset per intended step type) before the authoring UI is usable. No admin UI for campaign types yet.
- **P3 — Slug ↔ id ↔ enum alignment** keeps biting (asset `campaign_type` slug vs `campaign_type_id` UUID vs `CAMPAIGN_TYPE` enum). Already fixed in code twice (Slices 9/10); seeding must respect it (ISSUE-002).
